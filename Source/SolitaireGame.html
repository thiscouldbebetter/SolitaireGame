	<h3>Solitaire Game</h3>

	<p>
		Press the W, A, S, and D keys to move the cursor.
		Press the up and down arrow keys to select cards to move,
		the press the Enter key to pick up those cards,
		or drop any cards that are already picked up.
	</p>

	<div id="divMain"></div>

	<p>
		The object of the game is to move all the cards
		to the four goal cells on the upper-left part of the playfield,
		with a single suit in each cell, and all the cards within
		that suit sorted from the least (Ace) to the greatest (King) rank.
	</p>

	<p>
		Below, in the "tableau", a card may only be placed
		on either a card having the next-highest rank but with the opposite color,
		or on a vacant space from which all the cards have been removed.
	</p>

	<p>
		Cards may also be taken from the "kitty" at the upper right,
		and placed in the goal cells, tableau, or in the discard pile
		to the right of the kitty.  Cards may then be taken from the discard
		pile as well.  In some more formal versions of Solitaire,
		cards may only be moved from the kitty directly to the discard pile,
		and only in groups of three, and cards can't be moved from the discard pile
		back to the kitty after the kitty runs out of cards,
		all of which makes the game harder.  But no such rules
		are enforced in this version.
